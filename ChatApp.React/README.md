# Aspire Chat App Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the Aspire Chat App. This application is built using React and Vite, providing a modern and efficient framework for building user interfaces.

This application integrates the `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package, which enables seamless communication with our AI chat backend.

## Getting Started

The application uses the `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package to handle chat interactions. This package provides methods for both streaming and non-streaming requests, allowing for flexible communication with the chat backend.

To interact with the chat:

1. Type your prompt into the text box at the bottom of the chat interface.
2. Press the "Send" button to submit your prompt.
3. You can toggle between streaming and non-streaming mode using the button at the bottom.

When developing prompts for the chat, consider the following:

- Keep prompts concise and clear
- Use user-friendly language
- Consider all possible user responses
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully

Please refer to the `@microsoft/ai-chat-protocol` package documentation for more details on how to use these methods.
